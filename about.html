      <p>Hi, I'm a web developer. I am 11 years in grade six . My favourite programming language is HTML, CSS and
        Boostrap.I'm a versatile web designer due to my extensive history in graphic and web design. My dedication to
        continuously learning about new web design trends and concepts has made me a valuable member of the team. With
        eight years of experience and a master's in web design, my expertise can help customers modernize with websites
        and appeal to expanding customer populations.Iâ€™ve worked internationally, in-house, and remotely on projects for
        leading brands, agencies, startups, and charities. I care deeply about creating world-class, useful, and
        beautiful products that help people and make a difference. I can be as involved in your project as you need me
        to be; from the seed of the idea, to sketches, creative direction, design, copywriting, system design, and even
        the front-end and WordPress build. </p>
