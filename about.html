      <p>Hi, I'm a web developer. I am 11 years in grade six . My favourite programming language is HTML, CSS and
        Boostrap.I'm a versatile web designer due to my extensive history in graphic and web design. My dedication to
        continuously learning about new web design trends and concepts has made me a valuable member of the team. With
        eight years of experience and a master's in web design, my expertise can help customers modernize with websites
        and appeal to expanding customer populations.I’ve worked internationally, in-house, and remotely on projects for
        leading brands, agencies, startups, and charities. I care deeply about creating world-class, useful, and
        beautiful products that help people and make a difference. I can be as involved in your project as you need me
        to be; from the seed of the idea, to sketches, creative direction, design, copywriting, system design, and even
        the front-end and WordPress build. I got my start in technology as a self-taught coder, and since then I’ve never looked back. I specialize in front-end development, but I have a little bit of experience with everything from coding to QA to project management.

        I’m always looking for new challenges and opportunities, and I’m excited to see what the future holds for me in the world of tech. Thanks for reading! </p>
